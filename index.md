## Favorite CPSC-120L Labs

* Lab 1

    I really appreciated this lab because it demonstrated the basic foundation each lab would follow throughout the semester. I was able to get familiar with basic Git commands, editing the Authors.MD file, pair-programming, and how to push code. It allowed me to see what I was expected to do each lab and the work flow needed to complete the coding assignments. This lab helped me get introduced to how my future labs would run, how to manage repositories, and how to work well with different partners. 

* Lab 6 Part 1

    This lab stood out to me because it truly helped me understand the concept of command-line arguments better and made the idea of using them in code finally make sense to me. I also enjoyed how if-statements were incorporated constantly because it showed the different ways they can handle logic in programs without it being too difficult. This lab helped me learn how to check for the right number of arguments and use them correctly so it was able to show the correct sandwich output , and I appreciated that it was not too hard to follow. 



* Lab 11 Part 1 

    I enjoyed this lab because although it was very complex, it had repetitive steps of implementing functions such as accessors, constructors, and how they worked together inside a class allowing me to truly understand and practice it. I also liked seeing how much the program really relied on the demographics CSV file because the code was using that data to get the numbers that were needed to calculate the population density for a certain state. This lab helped me understand the class design, by setting up a class with the correct data and functions which allows the program to use the right calculations to produce the population's densities.
